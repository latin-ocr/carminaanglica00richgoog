111

Thou ling'ring star, with leff'ning ray, ,

, That lov'st to greet the early mom,
Again thou usher’st-in the day
My Mary from my soul was torn.

- OMary! dear departed ihade!

Where is thy place of blissrul rest?
See'st thou thy. lover lowly laid?
Hean'st thou the groans that tend his breast?

η Burns.
