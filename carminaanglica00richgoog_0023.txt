Me rather all that bfiwery loneliness,

The brooks of Eden mazily murmuring,=.
And bloom profuse and cedar arches
Charm, asa wanderer out in ocean,

Where some refulgent sunset of India -

Streams o'era rich ambrofial ocean isse, '.
And crimson-hued the stately palm-woods

Whisper in odorous heights of even.
