A belt of straw and ivy buds,
With coral clasps and amber studsz
An’ if these pleasutes may thee move,

Come live with me, and be my love.

The ihepherd swains shall dance and fing,
For thy delight each May-morning:
1f these delights thy mind may move,

Then live with me, and be my love. Ι

Marlowe.
